- 👋 Hi, I’m Sahil Chitnis
- 👀 I’m interested in Embedded and kernel software development.
- 🌱 I have 3+ years of experience writing production level code for safety critical systems and leading security features in this field while working for NVIDIA.
- 💞️ I have currently taken a break from work to pursue my 2nd Master's degree from New York University where i plan to work on some interesting research work 
     in this field and maybe write and publish a paper or two.
- 📫 I am open to collaborations / research work / internship / full time(after Dec 2021) opportunities and can be contacted / connected at ssc9983@nyu.edu or
     here on Linkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahil-chitnis-52933186/.
- My purpose is to create highly secure (to really keep the attackers at bay :D ) embedded systems to solve challenging problems
 concerning critical systems such as self driving cars, airplanes / rockets and affordable medical equipment.
     
I would love to hear from you, so feel free to drop me a Hello !
